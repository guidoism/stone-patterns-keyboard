# Stone Patterns Keyboard

A configurable ergonomic keyboard test-bed. Parts are connected with JST SH cables (6 pin and 4 pin) to a center module containing the MCU. The intent is to glue magnets to the bottom of the PCBs and move them around a [thin steel board](https://a.co/d/7oO9Udx) until I'm happy with the configuration and ready to build a case.

The stagger is taken from the [Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) and the thumb fan is an overlay of the Corne and the [Absolem](https://github.com/mrzealot/absolem). 

* 6x3 + 6 split
* Corne stagger
* Corne + Absolem thumb fan
* JST SH 4 and 6 pin connectors (4 pin is the same as Stemma QT)
* Connection between parts is raw columns and rows (not TRRS split protocol)
